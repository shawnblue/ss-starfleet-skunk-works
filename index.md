### The Workshop

:::prompt
A dimly lit, makeshift workshop hidden beneath the ruins of a bombed-out city.  
Flickering monitors display fragmented news feeds.  
The hum of improvised machinery fills the air.

You are a skilled but unrecognized engineer known only by your callsign: **Echo**.  
Once part of the planet’s elite tech consortium, you vanished underground after refusing to aid the oppressive regime.

Now, civil war rages. The regime has severed all traditional communication lines.  
Rebel factions remain isolated—cut off and vulnerable. The resistance is collapsing without coordination.

Suddenly, a coded transmission crackles through an encrypted channel:  
> "Echo, we've intercepted plans for a subspace frequency the regime can't trace. We need a prototype. You're our only hope."

:::

:::branch
* Rebel coordination is failing across continents.
* The resistance only has weeks—maybe days—left.
* A breakthrough device could unite them.

1. Investigate the intercepted plans: Analyze the schematics and assess feasibility.  
2. Assess available resources: Inventory your workshop for necessary components.  
3. Reach out to old contacts: Risk exposure to gather intelligence or parts.
