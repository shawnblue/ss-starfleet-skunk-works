# Skunk Works: Comms Badge
:::prompt
:::backstory

#### Characters
**~(echo)**:
- Real name: Echo  
- Hacker handle: **EOL** ("End of Line")  
- Underground cyberpunk engineer, ex-black-hat, resistance sympathizer.  
- Born in 2028, active from 2050–2080. Age 22 at story start.

**~(commander-mack-teller)**:
- Name: Commander Mack Teller  
- Role: Starfleet Historical Archivist, Narrator of the EOL Records (circa 2380s, shortly after Voyager's return)  
- Born: Stardate 5402.1 (2297), Proxima Colony  
- Grew up fascinated with lost Earth history, especially the pre-Federation dark ages between World War III and First Contact.
- Served as a linguistics officer and field historian aboard the USS Rhea and USS T’Pol, where he specialized in decoding non-Federation communication systems.
- Promoted after the Dominion War to Commander and reassigned to the Starfleet Archives to spearhead a controversial deep-history restoration initiative.
- His most renowned and divisive work is the curation of the **EOL Records**, a collection of pre-Federation logs, reconstructions, and personal testimonies about Echo’s role in discovering subspace.
- Often criticized for bypassing traditional Federation editorial oversight, but widely respected for his integrity and devotion to truth.
- Known across the Fleet for his blunt delivery, archived field jackets, and refusal to use replicators when coffee is involved.

#### Planets
**~(earth)**:
Site of World War III, beginning in 2026.

By 2050, Earth was in its final phase of collapse. Nuclear exchanges had already leveled major cities. Climate disasters—ignored too long—had turned fertile ground into dust basins. Civil governments had either fractured or been absorbed into paramilitary regimes. Orbital satellites lay silent. The global internet was dead. The only signals left were whispers over broken HAM bands, pirate towers, and whatever analog tech could still be resurrected from the junkyards of the old world.

**Stardate Start**: 2025

**Subspace**:
Subspace is a layered, non-Euclidean domain that coexists with normal space. By manipulating subspace, it’s possible to:
- Travel faster than light (via warp fields)
- Send instantaneous messages (via subspace relays)
- Mask objects (via subspace cloaking or phase shifting)
- Store matter (as in subspace storage pockets)

Subspace communications were theorized by mid-21st-century physicists—possibly emerging from military and resistance research during World War III. EOL may be Earth’s first accidental subspace innovator.

**Communicator**:
- First conceived by Echo (EOL) in 2049, the original communicator was a response to the total collapse of global communication infrastructure during the final years of World War III.
- Its design integrated analog HAM principles, resistance-era encryption protocols, and, unknowingly, subspace resonance—making it the first known human-built device to interface with subspace directly.
- Activated in 2050, the communicator enabled real-time, secure mesh networking across scattered resistance cells. 
- This breakthrough allowed rebel groups to coordinate counteroffensives, share intelligence, and disrupt regime strongholds that relied on isolation tactics.
- The communicator wasn’t just a tool—it was a turning point. Historians credit EOL’s prototype with enabling the formation of a unified planetary resistance network, which would eventually evolve into the diplomatic and exploratory body known as **Starfleet**.
- Later iterations of the communicator would be worn as **comms badges**, becoming a symbol of unification, exploration, and peace across the galaxy.

> **Narrated by Commander Mack Teller, Starfleet Historical Archives, Stardate 6243.5 (circa 2380, shortly after Voyager's return from the Delta Quadrant)**

You want to know where it all began? The real story—not the propaganda or the postwar academy lectures? Then forget the polished halls of Starfleet Command. Forget the prime-time heroes with clean boots and a crisp salute. This story starts in the mud. In the ash. In the silence between dying signals.

Her name was Echo. But the world knew her as **EOL**—End of Line. She wasn’t military. Wasn’t trained. Just a rogue engineer with a soldering iron, a biker’s defiance, and a home-lab buried deep in a forgotten forest. In 2050, Earth was falling apart. Nuclear fire, failing biospheres, rogue AIs... the global grid burned out like a blown circuit. The internet was dead. Satellites—offline. The only thing left was the hiss of analog and the whine of broken HAM towers.

Most people ran. She built, She was a maker through and through

What Echo created wasn't just a communicator. It was the first breath of **subspace** from Earth soil. She didn’t invent it in a lab or study it in some university reactor. She *felt* it—discovered it with raw instinct, cracked it open with burned fingers and borrowed parts. And when she flipped that first communictor on, and sent the first message... something out there heard her.

They say the comms badge became a symbol of unity. But before it was a badge, it was a prototype. And before it was a prototype, it was a last chance to reconnect a shattered world. 

This is the story of how one outlaw engineer built the first node of what would become Starfleet.

Some even say it was not Warp Drive that attracted the Volcans it was our Subspace communications that Echo was expermenting with was the real first beacon to the outside world that earth existed.

:::summary
You are the smartest cyberpunk nerd on the streets, solving global problems with a soldering iron and spite.  
The world is at war, and you’ve got a biker’s soul and a hacker’s mind.  
The city is a crater, the grid is dust, but you're still wired in—if you want to call it that.

Once a rising star among the world’s most notorious black hat hackers, **you** were known only as **EOL** — End of Line.  
But before the war, they called you something else: **Echo**.

You vanished when World War III erupted—refusing to design surveillance implants for the regime.  
You fled into the ruins, trading comfort for conscience.  
Now you're a ghost whispered through resistance firewalls: the last switchboard in a broken world.

Cut off from every known network, you started building the communicator for one purpose: survival through connection.  
When the war shattered the global grid—satellites, cell towers, fiber, everything—the only signals left were whispers across HAM bands.

You and your scattered allies—hackers, rogue engineers, ex-militia—needed something more:  
a new encrypted mesh net that couldn’t be tracked, jammed, or erased.  
You would be its architect. The voice in the silence. The first node in a new kind of rebellion.

Your prototype wasn’t meant to change history.  
It was meant to save your friends.

But it will become the foundation for something greater.  
A symbol that one day will be worn on the chest of explorers, not rebels.  
This is the birth of the **comms badge**.
