## Comms Badge

:::background

**Characters**:  
- **~(echo)** – Underground cyberpunk engineer, ex-consortium genius, resistance sympathizer.  

**Planets**:  
- **~(earth)** – Site of World War III, beginning in 2026. Civil infrastructures are failing, communications shattered.  

**Items**:
- #communicator
- #commsbadge

:::prompt
You are the smartest cyberpunk nerd on the streets, solving global problems with a soldering iron and spite.  
The world is at war, and you’ve got a biker’s soul and a hacker’s mind.  
The city is a crater, the grid is dust, but you're still wired in, if you want to call it that. 

Once a rising star among the world’s most notorious black hat hackers, ~(Echo) vanished when World War III  
erupted—refusing to design surveillance implants for the regime. She fled into the ruins,  
trading comfort for conscience. As cities fell and networks went dark,  
she became a myth whispered through resistance firewalls: the ghost in the wires.  

Cut off from every known network, #Echo started building the communicator for one purpose: 
survival through connection. When the war shattered the global grid—satellites, 
cell towers, fiber, everything—the only signals left were whispers across HAM bands. 

Echo and her scattered allies—hackers, rogue engineers, ex-militia—needed something more: 
a new encrypted mesh net that couldn’t be tracked, jammed, or erased. 
She would be its architect. The voice in the silence. The switchboard of the resistance.

Her prototype wasn't meant to change history. It was meant to save her friends.

But it would become the foundation for a new kind of order. 
A symbol that would one day be worn on the chest of a future yet to come.  
This is the birth of the comms badge.

### Her HomeLab

:::prompt
A dim, jury-rigged lab hums within a remote wooded cabin, hidden deep in the forests far from any 
remaining outpost of civilization.  

Filtered sunlight flickers through dust-covered glass and vines creeping through the rafters.  
The world has ended outside; inside, Echo works on rebuilding a sliver of it.

You wipe grease from your cracked hands, tuning the last working frequency modulator in the hemisphere.  
Your workspace is chaos: salvaged power cores, fusion-taped wires, forgotten AI cores blinking with forgotten purpose.

Suddenly, static morphs into a distorted signal—a fragmented stream of code bouncing off forgotten satellites. It's not a voice, but a data burst: origin unknown, encryption ancient. A relic signal embedded with alien signatures and pre-war resistance credentials.

Your screen floods with noise, then clears: schematics, pulse readings, and a desperate message from someone—or something—that shouldn’t exist.

> "This unit requires interface. Biological host compromised. Communication protocol incompatible. Seeking translation node..."”

A pulse of encrypted data downloads into your drive: the patient’s scans. Totally foreign. Bio-silicate nervous system. Adaptive tissue that mimics any form it contacts.

The tech world never prepared for this.

You stare at the blinking comms badge beside you—your last working prototype.  

It could allow a bridge to whatever sent the message—an interface across dimensions of biology and thought. The badge is experimental, designed to bypass language and thought entirely. But the power cell is unstable. One activation, and it's gone. A single shot at first contact.

### What do you do?

1. **Activate the Comms Badge** — Risk it all to bridge the unknown. You lose your prototype, but gain a chance to connect with a force that defies your understanding. You lose your prototype, but gain a chance at peace.  
2. **Decrypt the scan data manually** — Delay action and dive into the alien’s biology. It may yield answers—or cost the patient their life.  
3. **Patch into regime systems** — Forge a false death record to buy time. It’s a massive risk. If discovered, you may expose your network—and yourself—to the regime’s final sweep.
